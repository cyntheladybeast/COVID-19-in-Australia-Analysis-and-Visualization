This analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data conducted using Python Notebook aims to shed light on key aspects of the pandemic in Australia, from tracking a total of ten datasets pertaining to COVID-19 cases and deaths within five prominent Australian states, specifically referred to as 'New South Wales', 'Queensland,' 'South Australia,' 'Victoria,' and 'Western Australia.' 
These datasets contain information regarding the daily COVID-19 cases and fatality counts up to September 9, 2022.

According the summary statistics pertaining to COVID-19 cases, deaths and recovery ratesacross five Australian states, the highest average case counts were observed in New SouthWales (NSW), while the highest average death counts were recorded in Victoria (VIC). 
This observation implies that the recovery rates in NSW are comparatively more higher than those inVIC. Additionally, the lowest average case numbers were documented in South Australia (SA),and the lowest average death figures were reported in Western Australia (WA).
Over the past three years, it is evident that NSW and VIC have experienced a higher incidence ofCOVID-19 infections in comparison to South Australia and Western Australia. 
This disparity can be attributed, in part, to the notably higher populations in the former two states relative to thelatter two.
Moreover, the first 3 months of 2022 (Jan-Mar 2022) witnessed a notable increase in COVID-19infections across all states, except for Western Australia, which experienced a surge five monthslater, in May-June 2022.
Additionally, the relationship between new cases and deaths is unclear.  The correlation betweenthe number of new COVID-19 cases and the number of new deaths is likely only slightlypositive. However, there are occasional outliers in the datas
